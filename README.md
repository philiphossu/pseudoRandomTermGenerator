# Pseudo Random Term Generator

## About

TL;DR a failed test project put on hold.

This piece of Python 3 code generates pseudo random polynomial terms (or at least it should). It isn't exactly random in the correct sense, however. I made the incorrect assumption that every degree is equally as likely to appear, whereas in reality this is not true.

The purpose of this software was to be used in conjunction with my PHCpack project, specifically in the testing aspect.
