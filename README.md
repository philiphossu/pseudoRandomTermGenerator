##About

This piece of Python 3 code generates square systems of equations (or at least it should). These square systems have a pseudo-random number of terms, pseudo-random exponents, pseudo-random coefficients, and a pseudo-random constant.

The purpose of this software is to be used in conjunction with my PHCpack project, specifically in the testing aspect.
